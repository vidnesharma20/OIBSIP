`Problem statement`

- Iris flower has 3-species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements.
- Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species,
- and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurement of the iris species and classify them.

`Problem statement`

- Unemployment is measured by the unemployment rate which is the number of people who are unemployed as a percentage of the total labour force. 
- We have seen a sharp increase in the unemployment rate during Covid-19, 
- so analyzing the unemployment rate can be a good data science project.
